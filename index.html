			<h1>Welcome to Paint</h1>
			<p class = "margin-top">Paint is CSS framework that let's you 'paint' on styles with easy to remember
			classes.  It speeds up development time, makes code easy to maintain, and is <span class = "italic">
			totally</span> modular. </p>
			<p>Adapt the existing settings to your own needs. Use what you want, scrap the rest.
			Aside from the basic building blocks: banner, container, module ... nothing else carries any dependencies.
			If you need to make changes to specific elements, just give that element an id and add it to the overrides
			section of the css file.</p>
			<p class = "large bold">Except for font family and color choices, no extra css was written to create this page.
			What a time saver, eh?</p>
			
			<div class = "button margin-top bold">
				<a href = "#banner-intro-to-modules">I'm a banana!</a>

	<div class = "container align-center">
		<div class = "module per60 padding-right">
			<h3 class = "margin-bottom">Neat, I'm vertically centered!</h3>
			<p>If you wanted make the modules in this row aligned to the top, you would simply
			add the .align-top class to the modules in this row.  You could also apply the .align-bottom
			class.  Middle vertical alignment is the default.</p>
			<p>Notice that margins between text in this module are created with the margin-bottom class.  
			This is much more convenient than specifically identifying these elements in your css file
			and applying the margin that way, or worse, using inline styles.</p>

			<div class = "module per100 align-left panel special padding-medium" id = "module-panel-example">
				<h3 class = "margin-bottom">Use panels for special backgrounds</h3>
				<p>This is a panel module.  Panels are used when you have elements that require
				colored or special backgrounds.  
				<br><br>I've nested this panel module in a parent module, so I 
				can create some space between the panel and the module on its left.  If this
				wasn't a panel module, I wouldn't need to do that.</p>

			<div class = "container-inner align-center">
				<h3>Left side full width panel</h3>
				<p class = "italic margin-bottom">But still in the container!</p>
				<p>Normally, if you wanted a full width background color, you would use an id on the 
				section in question.  If you wanted to split the screen, with two <span class = "italic">
				different</span> colored backgrounds, you will do it a little differently.</p>
				<p>Instead of using the container class inside your section, you'll use the container-
				extended class.  That will ensure your modules are able to span the full width of the screen.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	
		<div class = "module per50 align-left padding-medium">
			<div class = "container-inner align-center">
				<h3>Right side full width panel</h3>
				<p class = "italic margin-bottom">But still in the container!</p>
				<p>Then, inside your two .module.per50 elements, you will use the container-inner class.
				This will keep your text bound to the same container as the rest of your site.  Easy, peasy!
				Take a look at the source to see it in action.
